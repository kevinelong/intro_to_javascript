# Introduction to Programming;
___
*with JavaScript!!!*

What is programming?
---
Programming is providing instructions (like a cooking recipe) for computers to execute (like a chef).

How do we provide the ___instructions___ to a computer?
---
We provide computers with instructions by creating plain-text-files (e.g. my_code.txt) in a text editor like Windows’ Notepad or Mackintosh TextEdit. 

In this text file we add lines of code called statements. By default these statements are executed top to bottom.

Statements are composed using a programming language such as JavaScript that defines reserved key-words that have special meaning in the language, and also literal values like numbers and text content, additionally we also use special symbols including the ones for basic arithmetic. 

If you already know how to give accurate “idiot-proof” directions in any area of your expertise then you are well on your way to learning to program.
